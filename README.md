# Customer-Sigup-Behaviour-and-Data-Audit
Our project was for Green Cart Ltd., a growing UK-based e-commerce company focused on eco-friendly household products. The company is preparing for its Q2 performance review, and we were asked you to investigate sales and customer behaviour across regions and product lines. This data-set, after cleaning and wrangling, was left with 3,004 transaction records, combining order, customer, product, and delivery information. The information in the data is structured to provide sales and customers behaviour insight. To determines which product drives the most revenue and in which region, how discount allowed and loyalty programme could contribute to sales. The data also provided insight on how delivery delay contributes to the business logistic challenges and how different group of customers relates or behaves towards different programme provided to improve sales. Each row represents an individual order line, including details such as order ID, customer and product identifiers, quantity, unit and base prices, revenue, discounts, and price bands. It also captures product metadata  such as category, launch date, supplier.
